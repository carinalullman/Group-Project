Hiking and Food (but Tacos are Best) and Beer, Oh My!

This is Ben and Carina and Gabes project

This app allows you to find a hike, as well as nearby breweries and restaurants (tacos, specifically!) so that you can burn calories first, then follow up with replacing those calories with beer and food.

Overview
Welcome to Project 1! This is an important step in your full-stack journey as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

Key Topics

Server-side APIs
Git branching workflow
Agile software development


Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

What is agile software development?
What is an MVP?
If you pull down a teammate's branch and you have merge conflicts, how do you handle it?


Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:

Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project
Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project
Resolve merge conflicts
Explain agile software development
Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages
Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project
